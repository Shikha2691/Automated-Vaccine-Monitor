# Automated-Vaccine-Monitor
This project aims to design a preventive system that will notify medical supervisors whenever the environmental conditions deviate from the optimal storage conditions required for vaccines.

At present, the storage systems available for vaccines are not proactive. They only sound an alarm after the vaccines have already expired. This leads to a considerable number of wasted vaccines every year, resulting in significant financial losses for the medical industry. Our project, the Vaccine Monitor, aims to design a preventive system that will notify medical supervisors whenever the environmental conditions deviate from the optimal storage conditions required for vaccines.
