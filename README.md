# Automated-Vaccine-Monitor
This project aims to design a preventive system that will notify medical supervisors whenever the environmental conditions deviate from the optimal storage conditions required for vaccines.

At present, the storage systems available for vaccines are not proactive. They only sound an alarm after the vaccines have already expired. This leads to a considerable number of wasted vaccines every year, resulting in significant financial losses for the medical industry. Our project, the Vaccine Monitor, aims to design a preventive system that will notify medical supervisors whenever the environmental conditions deviate from the optimal storage conditions required for vaccines.

A brief description of project:
Vaccine monitor Provides the vaccine storage environment used to maintain and distribute vaccines in optimal condition. This Project  is applicable to under developed and developing nations (like India) where the vaccines storage environment tracking is a big problem. When the environment is not optimal, the efficacy of these vaccines is lost. All the health worker carries is a portable box with some cold pads (door to door polio vaccine campaign). Our connected maraca has to help ensure the safety and efficacy of the vaccines. While the traveling health workers go around, based on the vaccine type and recommended environment setting, sensor data will be sent toÂ the phone via bluetooth.
Multiple sensors are used to monitor the environment of the portable box carrying the vaccines.
1) Temperature: Strict temperature range should be maintained, otherwise raise alert.
2) Light Sensor: Over exposure to light can spoil the vials, raise alert.
3) Air Quality: Degradation in air quality means, insulation is not working properly, raise alert.
4) Buzzer: To raise alert.
